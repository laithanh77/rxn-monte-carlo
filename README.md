For CEM 484 honors project.

cannonical ensemble MC, where the translation and rotations are governed by a transition probaiblity. An average time step dt is derived from the average displacement of a translation and the average Vrms at 300K. At every dt, a laser pulse hits the system and each I2 atom has a probability of dissociation based on a guassian curve
Formation of HI is based on the trajectory of the I2 dissociation (collision with H2 = formation)

Code still has bugs (crashes after 4 hours of simulation), features are not fully fleshed out
